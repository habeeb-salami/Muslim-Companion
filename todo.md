You are an expert full-stack Chrome Extension developer and software architect. I want to build a lightweight, ad-free, privacy-focused Chrome extension called "Muslim Companion" that serves as an all-in-one Islamic tool for minimalists.

Core features:

Accurate prayer time notifications with location detection and adjustable sounds (Adhan, soft tone, silent).

Dynamic Qibla compass (works offline after first fetch).

Daily Quran verse with translation and Tafsir link.

Daily Hadith from authentic sources.

Dua of the Day with Arabic, transliteration, and meaning.

Hijri + Gregorian calendar with Islamic event highlights.

Optional to-do list with Islamic reminders.

Optional distraction block mode during Salah times.

Multiple language support.

Clean minimalist UI with theme options.

Works offline for most features and stores data locally.

Constraints:

Manifest V3 compliance.

Lightweight and optimized for speed.

No ads, analytics, or trackers.

Open source friendly structure.

Deliverables I want from you in this first output:

Full technical architecture outline (folder structure, manifest.json config, and how each feature will be implemented).

List of APIs/libraries to use (prayer times, Hadith, Quran, Qibla, Hijri date).

Recommended front-end framework (React, vanilla JS, or other) and justification.

Data flow diagram showing how user data and settings will be handled locally.

Breakdown of background scripts, content scripts, and popup scripts with their responsibilities.

Suggested development milestones (MVP â†’ full release).

Any security or privacy considerations specific to this extension.

Your output should be concise but fully actionable so I can immediately start building in Cursor.
